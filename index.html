        <h1>IMALI ESIERA</h1>
        <h2>Front-End Developer and Accountant</h2>

        <p>
          I have always wanted to venture into the software and programming
          world. Since 2017 I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in a totally
          unrelated field. I also possess a Postgraduate Degree in Tax
          Administration. I enjoyed every step of my learning and plan on using
          my software skills to further leverage my other skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I however would not say that I tok this journey all on my own because
          I was helped immensely by Austin, a highly skilled senior software
          engineer. Through his guidance and knowledge, I have been able to
          advance my skills. The direction he has provided has steered me toward
          the best paths while learning on my own. I really appreciate his
          input.
