          <h2>Front-End Developer and Accountant</h2>

          <p>
            I have always wanted to venture into the software and programming
            world. Since 2017 I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in a totally
            unrelated field. I also possess a Postgraduate Degree in Tax
            Administration. I enjoyed every step of my learning and plan on
            using my software skills to further leverage my other skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, however, would not say that I took this journey all on my own. I
            was assisted immensely by Austin, a highly skilled senior software
            engineer. Through his guidance and knowledge, I have been able to
            advance my skills. The direction he has provided has steered me
            toward the best paths while learning on my own. I really appreciate
            his input.
